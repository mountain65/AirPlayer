AirPlayer
=========

A Mono based library to access your AppleTV using the AirPlay protocol

This is a set of simple classes that implement the AirPlay protocol (as described at http://nto.github.com/AirPlay.html), 
allowing you to send pictures and movies to your AppleTV. It was inspired by the code that was published by Sebastian Pouliot 
on http://github.com/spouliot/airplay and described on his blog at http://spouliot.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/airplay-vs-large-digital-frame. 

It is completely Mono based and has no dependencies on iOS classes like NSNetService for dns-sd.
